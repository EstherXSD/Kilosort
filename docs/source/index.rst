Kilosort4
==========

Kilosort4 is a Python package for spike sorting on GPUs with template matching.
The software uses new graph-based approaches to clustering that improve performance
compared to `previous versions <https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort>`_. For
detailed comparisons to past versions of Kilosort and to other spike-sorting methods,
please see our pre-print on `BioArxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.07.523036v1>`_.
